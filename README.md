# Arcadia-Science/test-datasets

This repository stores datasets for testing workflows and information about the test dataset - such as the use cases for the pared down dataset, how the dataset was generated, and where the full-sized version of the test dataset can be found.

## Repository Structure

Each test dataset is contained within an individual directory.
If the test dataset is associated with a specific workflow, the directory is named for that workflow.
Each directory contains a README that describes:
1. The purpose or intended use cases for the test dataset
2. How the test dataset was generated
3. Information and location of the full-sized dataset from which the test dataset was generated
